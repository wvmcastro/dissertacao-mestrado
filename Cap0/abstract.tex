The Simultaneous Localization and Mapping problem, known by the acronym SLAM, asks whether it is possible for a robot to be placed in an environment
unknown a priori, and incrementally build a map of this
environment while simultaneously locating itself on this map without the
need for a location infrastructure such as GPS.

Solving the SLAM problem is critical for mobile robotics
autonomy. However, although already solved, it is not a trivial task.
both from a theoretical and implementation point of views.
Depending on robot dynamics, sensors used, computing power available or need for navigation and guidance, the solution
can become more or less complex.

This work develops a multi-agent solution in a simulated environment
for the 2D SLAM problem. For this, it uses the Sparse Extended Information Filter, along with other algorithms for navigation,
data association and map representation. The advantages of the distributed solution of the
SLAM problem, in comparison with the original problem, are workload sharing
between the agents and the information redundancy.
